### A list of books I've read in no particular order!

| Title                    | Author           | Review                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Book Of My Lives         | Aleksander Hemon | Fast-paced memoir that hits close to home. Hemon almost paints his stories.                                                                                   |
| A City is Not a Computer | Shannon Mattern  | Metaphoric analysis of cities in a data-driven/computing context. Case studies around North America. Not _the_ smart cities book, though. Too many metaphors. |
