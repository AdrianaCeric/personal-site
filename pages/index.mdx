# Hey, I'm Adriana

Right now, I'm a second-year Civil Engineering student at UWaterloo interested in (both physical and digital) infrastructure, transit software and affordable housing solutions. I'm also a Growth Coordinator at [Urban Minds](https://www.urbanminds.co/) where I help spearhead opportunities for youth to create urban change in their communities.

I've spent a lot of time talking into microphones to [meet new people](https://anchor.fm/from-the-stem-up), [reflect](https://anchor.fm/gallium-podcast), [encourage more women in engineering](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy84NjA3MjE5Yy9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw?sa=X&ved=0CAMQ4aUDahcKEwiQ4qzu4IX5AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAQ&hl=en-CA) or [voice my concerns about Canadian urban space](https://play.thebentway.ca/). When I'm not editing a podcast, I can be found cross-country skiing through forests in the winter.

Lately, I've been focusing on [transit data](posts/gtfs-101), transportation engineering, open-sourced software and [urban visualizations](https://github.com/AdrianaCeric/city-street-networks). I love software development as much as I love civil engineering. When combined, I've found that both fields can make a lot of impact on cities. I first got into coding by building projects at a bunch of [hackathons](https://devpost.com/adrianaceric). I then joined at [RBC](https://www.rbc.com/about-rbc.html) in high school where I wrote code at their [Tech Labs](https://www.rbc.com/dms/enterprise/futurelaunch/rbc-summer-tech-labs.html). I returned at the bank for my first co-op building their housing and mortgage applications which was very cool.

Feel free to stroll through my projects (either [here](/projects) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/AdrianaCeric/city-street-networks)), read my [posts](/posts), request my [resume](mailto:adriana.ceric@gmail.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriana-ceric/)!

I'm always open to chat about anything; [email me!](mailto:adriana.ceric@gmail.com)
