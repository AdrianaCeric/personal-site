# Hi, I'm Adriana

Right now, I'm a second-year Civil Engineering student at UWaterloo interested in (both physical and digital) infrastructure, affordable housing and transit.

Outside of school, I volunteer as a Growth Coordinator at [Urban Minds](https://www.urbanminds.co/). Some of my favourite things to do in my free time include [hosting](https://anchor.fm/from-the-stem-up) [lots](https://anchor.fm/gallium-podcast) [of](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy84NjA3MjE5Yy9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw?sa=X&ved=0CAMQ4aUDahcKEwiQ4qzu4IX5AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAQ&hl=en-CA) [podcasts](https://play.thebentway.ca/) and cross-country skiing.

My software journey sparked by building projects at a bunch of [hackathons](https://devpost.com/adrianaceric). I then joined at [RBC](https://www.rbc.com/about-rbc.html) in high school where I wrote code at their [Tech Labs](https://www.rbc.com/dms/enterprise/futurelaunch/rbc-summer-tech-labs.html). I returned at the bank for my first co-op building their housing and mortgage applications. I'm currently exploring open-sourced software, urban visualizations and transit data applications.

Feel free to stroll through my [projects](/projects) or [posts](/posts), request my [resume](mailto:adriana.ceric@gmail.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriana-ceric/)!
