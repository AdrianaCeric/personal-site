# Hey, I'm Adriana

I'm a fifth year Civil Engineering student at UWaterloo interested in [transit data](posts/gtfs-101), transportation engineering/planning and [open source software](https://github.com/AdrianaCeric). I love combining software development and civil engineering throughout a lot of my work; I've found that both fields can make a lot of impact on cities.

I am fortunate to be recognized by the [Transportation Association of Canada (TAC)](https://www.tac-atc.ca/en/), the [Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE)](https://www.itecanada.org/), and the [Women's Transportation Seminar Foundation (WTS)](https://www.wtsinternational.org/wts-foundation/about/mission) for my work and research in transit technology.

My work:

- Working on [Stage 2 of the ION light rail train project](https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/exploring-the-region/stage2ion.aspx) from Kitchener --> Cambridge! ðŸš†
- Worked on mobility hub and transportation planning projects at Stantec
- Joined the [OpenTripPlanner Project](http://www.opentripplanner.org/) to improve trip planning accessibility for transit agencies.
- Worked on [TRANSIT-data-tools](https://mtc-datatools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a platform to help transit agencies, big and small, manage their GTFS data.
- Launched and organized youth city building events and experiments at [Urban Minds](https://www.urbanminds.co/).
- Collaborated with [a team of students at my school](https://www.warriorhome.ca/) to retrofit and outline finances for century-old residential homes in Kitchener, Ontario Canada, making them energy-efficient and affordable for a local Indigenous family!
- Helped make the housing and mortgage process easier for tens of thousands of clients as a software developer at the [Royal Bank of Canada (RBC)](https://www.rbc.com/about-rbc.html).

When I'm not thinking about light rail trains, I can be found cross-country skiing, travelling, [reading](/books) or [painting](/art)!

Feel free to stroll through my [projects](/projects) or my open-source contributions on [GitHub](https://github.com/AdrianaCeric), read my [posts](/posts), request my [resume](mailto:adriana.ceric@gmail.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriana-ceric/)!

I'm always open to chat about anything. [My inbox is open!](mailto:adriana.ceric@gmail.com)
