# Hey, I'm Adriana

I'm a second-year Civil Engineering student at UWaterloo interested in (both physical and digital) infrastructure as well as how tech can improve transit, housing and construction systems.

Lately, I've been focusing on [transit data](posts/gtfs-101), transportation engineering, open-sourced software and [urban visualizations](https://github.com/AdrianaCeric/city-street-networks). I love software development as much as I love civil engineering. When combined, I've found that both fields can make a lot of impact on cities. I first got into coding by building projects at a bunch of [hackathons](https://devpost.com/adrianaceric). I then joined [RBC](https://www.rbc.com/about-rbc.html) starting in high school where I wrote code at their [Tech Labs](https://www.rbc.com/dms/enterprise/futurelaunch/rbc-summer-tech-labs.html) and on the housing and mortgage applications team.

Most recently, I joined the [OpenTripPlanner Project](http://www.opentripplanner.org/) to write open-source software for North American transit agencies at [Arcadis IBI Group](https://www.ibigroup.com/). I'm also a Growth Coordinator at [Urban Minds](https://www.urbanminds.co/) where I help spearhead opportunities for youth to create urban change in their communities.

When I'm not thinking about light rail trains, I can be found cross-country skiing through forests in the winter, booking train tickets, improving on my tennis skills or [gouache painting](/art).

Feel free to stroll through my [projects](/projects) or my open-source contributions on [GitHub](https://github.com/AdrianaCeric), read my [posts](/posts), request my [resume](mailto:adriana.ceric@gmail.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriana-ceric/)!

I'm always open to chat about anything; [email me!](mailto:adriana.ceric@gmail.com)
