# Hi, I'm Adriana

Right now, I'm a Civil Engineering student at UWaterloo interested in (both physical and digital) infrastructure, transit development and smart cities. I am currently on my first co-op term working on mortgage and housing applications at RBC.

I am also empowering youth to build equitable cities at [Urban Minds](https://www.urbanminds.co/) and scouting early-stage construction-tech startups at [HometeamVC](https://www.hometeam.vc/). In my free time, I [host](https://anchor.fm/from-the-stem-up) [lots](https://anchor.fm/gallium-podcast) [of](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy84NjA3MjE5Yy9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw?sa=X&ved=0CAMQ4aUDahcKEwiQ4qzu4IX5AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAQ&hl=en-CA) [podcasts](https://play.thebentway.ca/) and cross-country ski.

In the past, I wrote code at RBC's [Tech Labs](https://www.rbc.com/dms/enterprise/futurelaunch/rbc-summer-tech-labs.html) and went to a bunch of [hackathons](https://devpost.com/adrianaceric).
