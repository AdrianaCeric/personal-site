# Hi, I'm Adriana

Right now, I'm a Civil Engineering student at UWaterloo interested in (both physical and digital) infrastructure, transit development and smart cities. I am currently on my first co-op term working on mortgage and housing applications at RBC.
I am also empowering youth to build equitable cities at [Urban Minds](https://www.urbanminds.co/). In my free time, [I](https://anchor.fm/from-the-stem-up) [host](https://anchor.fm/gallium-podcast) [podcasts](https://play.thebentway.ca/), cross-country ski or [paint](https://adrianaceric.medium.com/why-you-should-paint-with-gouache-2c33e9111829).

In the past, I wrote code at RBC's [Tech Labs](https://www.rbc.com/dms/enterprise/futurelaunch/rbc-summer-tech-labs.html) and went to a bunch of [hackathons](https://devpost.com/adrianaceric).
