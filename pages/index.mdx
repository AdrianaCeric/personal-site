# Hey, I'm Adriana

I'm a second-year Civil Engineering student at UWaterloo interested in (both physical and digital) infrastructure as well as how tech can improve transit, housing and construction systems.

Lately, I've been focusing on [transit data](posts/gtfs-101), transportation engineering and open-sourced software. I love combing software development and civil engineering throughout a lot of my work. When combined, I've found that both fields can make a lot of impact on cities.

Some things I've done:

- Collaborated with [a team of students at my school](https://www.warriorhome.ca/) to retrofit and outline finances for century-old residential homes in Kitchener, Ontario Canada, making them energy-efficient and affordable for a family of Indigenous tenants!
- Joined the [OpenTripPlanner Project](http://www.opentripplanner.org/) at [Arcadis IBI Group](https://www.ibigroup.com/) to improve trip planning accessibility for major transit agencies such as Trimet and MARTA.
- Helped make the housing and mortgage process easier for tens of thousands of clients as a software developer at the [Royal Bank of Canada (RBC)](https://www.rbc.com/about-rbc.html).

When I'm not thinking about light rail trains, I can be found cross-country skiing through forests in the winter, booking train tickets, listening to Kaytranada or [gouache painting](/art).

Feel free to stroll through my [projects](/projects) or my open-source contributions on [GitHub](https://github.com/AdrianaCeric), read my [posts](/posts), request my [resume](mailto:adriana.ceric@gmail.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriana-ceric/)!

I'm always open to chat about anything; [email me!](mailto:adriana.ceric@gmail.com)
