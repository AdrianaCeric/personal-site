# Hi, I'm Adriana

Right now, I'm a Civil Engineering student at UWaterloo interested in (both physical and digital) infrastructure, transit development and smart cities. I am also empowering youth to build equitable cities at [Urban Minds](https://www.urbanminds.co/).

In the past, I wrote code at RBC's [Tech Labs](https://www.rbc.com/dms/enterprise/futurelaunch/rbc-summer-tech-labs.html).

Stroll through my [projects](/projects), request my [resume](mailto:adriana.ceric@gmail.com) or connect with me through [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriana-ceric/)!
