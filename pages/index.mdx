Hey, I'm Adriana! ðŸšŒðŸŒ±

I am a fifth-year Civil Engineering student at UWaterloo, which is to say I have spent five years learning to think about structural, water resources, and soil/rock systems in increasingly sophisticated ways, though I find myself drawn instead to the science of human movement: how people get from one place to another, and why they so often cannot.
My fascination with [transit data](posts/gtfs-101), [open source software](https://github.com/AdrianaCeric), and in transportation engineering started with countless hours riding buses to and from high school and work. I noticed everything: inaccessible bus stops in the winter, schedules that were more aspiration than promise, and systems that felt designed by people who'd never actually used them.

**What I believe**:

- **Mobility is freedom.** Nobody should find their movement constrained by unreliable systems, whether they travel by car, bus, train, bike, or mobility device.
- **Good transit creates good places.** Communities with fast, punctual transit and thoughtful spaces for walking and cycling become places people want to live, not just endure.
- **There is no perfect transportation system.** Every city that tries to become Amsterdam will fail in interesting ways, but at the end of the day, every city can manage to run a decent bus network, which is perhaps all most of us really need.

**My work**:

- Working on [Stage 2 of the ION rapid transit project](https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/exploring-the-region/stage2ion.aspx) from Kitchener --> Cambridge! ðŸš†
- Worked on mobility hub and transportation planning projects at Stantec
- Joined the [OpenTripPlanner Project](http://www.opentripplanner.org/) to improve trip planning accessibility for transit agencies.
- Worked on [TRANSIT-data-tools](https://mtc-datatools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a platform to help transit agencies, big and small, manage their GTFS data.
- Launched and organized youth city building events and experiments at [Urban Minds](https://www.urbanminds.co/).
- Collaborated with [a team of students at my school](https://www.warriorhome.ca/) to retrofit and outline finances for century-old residential homes in Kitchener, Ontario Canada, making them energy-efficient and affordable for a local Indigenous family!
- Helped make the housing and mortgage process easier for tens of thousands of clients as a software developer at the [Royal Bank of Canada (RBC)](https://www.rbc.com/about-rbc.html).

When I'm not thinking about light rail trains, I can be found cross-country skiing, travelling, [reading](/books) or [painting](/art)!
