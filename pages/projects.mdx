## Net-Zero, Affordable Home in Kitchener, Ontario Canada

Our team was tasked to showcase a blend of architectural and engineering innovation through the design and construction of high-performance, low-carbon buildings powered by renewable energy.
We designed and built a Work on the two-storey house, which was donated to the KWUNWP by Waterloo Region after sitting vacant for several years.

## Timber Design Project

Worked in a team of four to design an emergency station out of timber using the Canadian Wood Design Manual.

- Determined loading requirements by accounting for the dead load, snow load, and wind load, to size the structural members
- Selected beam and column locations and sizes by iteration to determine the most cost-efficient alternative
- Produced design drawings with details of specific sections using AutoCAD
